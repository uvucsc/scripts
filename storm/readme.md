# Storm
storm.go is a script that was thrown together as a way to practice for RMCCDC. It was inspired by Cyber Security competitions like [Hivestorm](http://hivestorm.org/).

## About
It's a huge mess of spaghetti that somehow works. Hopefully I'll come back and rebuild this in the future.
The script works by checking if misconfigurations have been fixed on a pre-shared VM.

## Usage
This is made to be ran on a VPS to display the score while the client scores from a local VM.

It's also not secure at all so reverse engineering could be another fun way to use this script.
